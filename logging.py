# Logger − It is the main entry point that you use to emit log messages. Each logger instance is named and can be configured independently.

# Handler − It determines where log messages are sent. Handlers send log messages to different destinations such as the console, files, sockets, etc.

# Formatter − It specifies the layout of log messages. Formatters define the structure of log records by specifying which information to include (e.g., timestamp, log level, message).

# Logger Level − It defines the severity level of log messages. Messages below this level are ignored. Common levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.

# Filter − It is the optional components that provide finer control over which log records are processed and emitted by a handler.

# Logging in Python
# Logging is the process of recording messages during the execution of a program to provide runtime information that can be useful for monitoring, debugging, and auditing.

# In Python, logging is achieved through the built-in logging module, which provides a flexible framework for generating log messages.

# Logging Levels
# Logging levels in Python define the severity of log messages, allowing developers to categorize and filter messages based on their importance. Each logging level has a specific purpose and helps in understanding the significance of the logged information −

# DEBUG − Detailed information, typically useful only for debugging purposes. These messages are used to trace the flow of the program and are usually not seen in production environments.

# INFO − Confirmation that things are working as expected. These messages provide general information about the progress of the application.

# WARNING − Indicates potential issues that do not prevent the program from running but might require attention. These messages can be used to alert developers about unexpected situations.

# ERROR − Indicates a more serious problem that prevents a specific function or operation from completing successfully. These messages highlight errors that need immediate attention but do not necessarily terminate the application.

# CRITICAL − The most severe level, indicating a critical error that may lead to the termination of the program. These messages are reserved for critical failures that require immediate intervention.


import logging
# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
# Example usage
def calculate_sum(a, b):
   logging.debug(f"Calculating sum of {a} and {b}")
   result = a + b
   logging.info(f"Sum calculated successfully: {result}")
   return result
# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
   logging.info("Starting the program")
   result = calculate_sum(10, 20)
   logging.info("Program completed")



# import logging
# # Create logger
# logger = logging.getLogger('my_app')
# logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set global log level
# # Create console handler and set level to debug
# console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
# console_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
# # Create formatter
# formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
# console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
# # Add console handler to logger
# logger.addHandler(console_handler)
# # Example usage
# logger.debug('This is a debug message')
# logger.info('This is an info message')
# logger.warning('This is a warning message')
# logger.error('This is an error message')
# logger.critical('This is a critical message')



# Types of Logging Handlers
# Following are the various types of logging handlers in Python −

# StreamHandler − Sends log messages to streams such as sys.stdout or sys.stderr. Useful for displaying log messages in the console or command line interface.

# FileHandler − Writes log messages to a specified file on the file system. Useful for persistent logging and archiving of log data.

# RotatingFileHandler − Similar to FileHandler but automatically rotates log files based on size or time intervals. Helps manage log file sizes and prevent them from growing too large.

# SMTPHandler − Sends log messages as emails to designated recipients via SMTP. Useful for alerting administrators or developers about critical issues.

# SysLogHandler − Sends log messages to the system log on Unix-like systems (e.g., syslog). Allows integration with system-wide logging facilities.

# MemoryHandler − Buffers log messages in memory and sends them to a target handler after reaching a certain buffer size or timeout. Useful for batching and managing bursts of log messages.

# HTTPHandler − Sends log messages to a web server via HTTP or HTTPS. Enables logging messages to a remote server or logging service.
